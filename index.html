			<h2>Travel ✈️</h2>
			<p>
			I love to travel and discover new cultures. I lived in China for 5 years, in Shanghai when I was little 🇨🇳. It was a very nice multicultural experience. I also did a 5 week exchange in Sydney with an Australian pen pal 🇦🇺. I have very good memories of it. I would like to do part of my studies and my adult life abroad to extend my international experiences.

			<h2>Fashion 🛍</h2>
			<p>
			I really like fashion. That's why I took the initiative to do a one-week internship at Kenzo which is a ready-to-wear brand. I learned a lot, both in the office and in the field in the boutiques. It was on this occasion that I discovered the merchandising sector in which I would like to work in the future since I participated in the implementation of a new collection in the store. Jacquemus, Versace and Mugler are brands that I find particularly inspiring.

			<h2>Sport</h2>
			<p>
			I like sports. I played tennis 🎾 for 10 years but I stopped this year to start dancing. I also do a lot of sailing every summer: catamaran and windsurfing 🏄🏽‍♀️. Finally, I am passionate about skiing ⛷.

			<h2>Art 🎨</h2>
			<p>
			I am very sensitive to works of art. I like to visit museums and exhibitions. I particularly like the museum of decorative arts and the museum of modern art in Paris. Recently, I did the Mugler exhibition which I liked very much.
